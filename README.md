This is a simple console application which will generate 4 random secret numbers. The goal is to find out the right sequence of numbers.

You will be asked to guess which are the numbers and the application will provide you the following results:
 - an X means you put a number in the exact position 
 - a O means you put the right number in the wrong position

The game will end when you enter the right numbers in the right positions or when you quit (right now by forcing yourself out using Ctrl + C)
